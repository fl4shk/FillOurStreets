Simple genetic algorithm test thing

Command Line Arguments: population_size crossover_rate mutation_rate


Starting from *population_size* random strings all the same length as the string to find, 
this performs a basic genetic algorithm that eventually should end up with one of the
strings matching the target.


I've seen it take as long as 12 minutes on my machine for the default string to search for.


I wrote this just as a way to learn how to implement genetic algorithms myself, but perhaps
it will be helpful as an example of how to do so for more interesting projects.
